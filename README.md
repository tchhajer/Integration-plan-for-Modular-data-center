# Modular Data Center Integration Plan

## Overview

This project outlines a comprehensive integration and layout strategy for the production of a large-scale **Modular Data Center**. Developed using **AutoCAD**, the project was created for a high-profile client and addressed key logistical challenges posed by space constraints within the production facility.

The plan aimed to streamline production by optimizing equipment placement, defining clear workflows, and enabling cross-functional coordination through detailed visual guides and a phased execution schedule.

## Key Features

- **AutoCAD Layout Design**: Developed a detailed, scalable production layout for the modular data center.
- **Installation Visualization**: Created visual guides and sequence plans to support fast, safe, and repeatable assembly.
- **Staging Area Positioning**: Precisely mapped staging zones to improve material flow and minimize bottlenecks.
- **Work Schedule Timeline**: Established an optimized, realistic timeline for every step in the integration process.
- **Space-Conscious Engineering**: Tailored the entire production and staging layout to fit a space-limited environment.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Enabled seamless coordination among engineering, logistics, and shop floor personnel.
- **Manufacturing Optimization**: The process reduced cycle time, prevented errors, and allowed for efficient floor planning.

## Tools Used

- AutoCAD
- Excel (timeline planning)
- On-site evaluations and measurement tools

## Impact

- Reduced production setup and execution time
- Improved clarity in production handoffs and communication
- Allowed for visual planning and agile response to design or facility changes
